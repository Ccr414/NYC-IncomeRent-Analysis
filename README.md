# NYC-IncomeRent-Analysis
A data visualization project investigating the changes in rent and income data throughout the past six years. The focus is primarily on income/rent post-Covid and consists of data from neighborhoods all across New York City. This project also analyzes the past, present, and potential future relationship between rent and income.

This project was completed in September 2023, but is currently being updated to include the new government income data from 2022. Alongside the extra data, the project is being updated with more efficient and readable code along with several other data analysis techniques (i.e. using machine learning algorithms such as: linear regression, decision trees, and random forest). There will be more visualizations with the increased analysis and the past visualizations will be more effective by trading matplotlib graphics with seaborn's visualization library.

The "Old Code" folder includes the original unaltered code, and is included to more explicitly show changes and to show my personal progress in coding and data science.

The "data" folder includes all data files used in the project. Some will be removed once the project is fully updated, and more effective data files are created.

The Data Visualization file is the only file meant to be run, the other files are for cleaning, preparing, and investigating the data beforehand.
